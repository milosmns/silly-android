Silly Android (WIP)
===================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/milosmns/silly-android.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/milosmns/silly-android)

What is this?
-------------
_Silly Android_ is a library with Android framework plugins used to make the default Android API easy to use. We all know that there are some design mistakes in the API that are relatively easy to fix, and we copy the 'fixes' over and over, from one project to another - Silly Android is aiming to address these really silly issues and allow you to include the 'fixes' with a single dependency in your build configuration file.

Requirements
------------
- Gradle (`jCenter` and `mavenCentral` are both supported)
- Latest AppCompat

To include the dependency, add this to your app's `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
  // not uploaded yet, hang on..
```

Examples
--------
```java
  // working on it..
```

Support
